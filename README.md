### To Do: Create or find an array, print the array but change it in some way

- My group made the array for sports, so I will use this
- Copy the array into my page and give it a name
- Create an empty string variable so that each item in the array has somewhere to go
- create a for loop that goes from the first to the last item
    - 17 items in the array, start at 0
- make the for loop go through each item and print it into the empty string 
    - print it to screen
- Now we want to make each item on a seperate line, we can do this using an html break tag
- To change my assignment I want to capitalize the beginning of every word
    - To do this, we need to use the charAt() and toUpperCase() tags
    - I want the first character, so we will assign charAt to 0
    - Only printing the first letter now ??
        - Need to use the substr tag to fix this issue
        - the toUpperCase tag operator is printing the new string, but not modifying the original [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7743582/trying-to-capitalize-the-first-character-in-array-of-strings-why-this-is-not-wo)

- Print my new and improved array to the screen using document.getElementById().innerHTML
